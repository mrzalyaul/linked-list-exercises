 * Deletes the node at a specific position in the linked list.
 * Positions are 0-based; if the position is out of bounds, the list remains unchanged.
 * Example: Given 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and position 2, it becomes 1 -> 2 -> 4
 * Example: Given 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 and position 0, it becomes 2 -> 3 -> 4
 *
 * @param {LinkedListNode} head - The head of the linked list.
 * @param {number} position - The position of the node to delete.
 * @returns {LinkedListNode} The head of the list, which may change if the first element is deleted.
