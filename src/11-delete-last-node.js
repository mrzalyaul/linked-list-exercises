/**
 * Removes the last node from the linked list and returns the head of the list.
 * If the list is empty, it returns null.
 * This operation modifies the list by traversing it to find the second-last node and updating its next pointer to null, effectively removing the last node.
 * If the list contains only one node, the list becomes empty.
 * Example: Given 1 -> 2 -> 3, after removal, it becomes 1 -> 2. If the list contains only one node, it becomes empty.
 *
 * @param {Node} head - The head of the linked list.
 * @returns {Node} The head of the list after the last node has been removed.
