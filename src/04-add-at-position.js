 * Inserts a new element at a specific position in the linked list.
 * If the position is greater than the list length, the element is not added.
 * Example: Given 1 -> 2 -> 4 and you add 3 at position 2, it becomes 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
 * Example: Given 1 -> 2 -> 3 and you add 4 at position 4, it becomes 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
 *
 * @param {LinkedListNode} head - The head of the linked list.
 * @param {*} value - The value to insert.
 * @param {number} position - The position at which to insert the new node.
 * @returns {LinkedListNode} The head of the list, which may be a new node if inserted at the start.
