/**
 * Deletes the first node from the linked list and returns the new head of the list.
 * If the list is empty, it returns null.
 * This operation modifies the list by removing the first element, effectively making the second element (if any) the new head of the list.
 * Example: Given 1 -> 2 -> 3, after deletion, it becomes 2 -> 3. If the list is empty, it remains empty.
 *
 * @param {Node} head - The head of the linked list.
 * @returns {Node} The new head of the list after the first node has been deleted.
